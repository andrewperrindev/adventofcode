# Advent of Code 2023

Each folder in this repo is a separate coding challenge that was part of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com) event. Like a traditional advent calendar, each day was a new coding challenge. In addition, each coding challenge had two parts.

There is a README in each folder to explain the context of that day's challenge, but here is the general introduction to the event, and a summary of each day's challenge.

## Introduction

Each day in the Advent of Code provided a new backstory to that day's coding challenge. For copyright reasons, I'm not including the backstory for each day, but instead a summary of what the resulting code should do. Please visit [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com) for the flavor text & why each day has the name it does.

## Summary

* Day 1 (*Trebuchet?!*): Parse out numbers from a text document in two different ways.
* Day 2 (*Cube Conundrum*): Parse various game states to figure out if they are valid (part 1) or what state is needed to make them valid (part 2).
* Day 3 (*Gear Ratios*): Given a text document of numbers and symbols, locate numbers that are horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent to various symbols.
* Day 4 (*Scratchcards*): Try to figure out how much you've won in a pile of lottery cards. Part 1 & part 2 each use a different method to calcuate your winnings.
* Day 5 (*If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer*): Use various mapping tables to translate source values to destination values, with the ultimate goal of finding the smallest destination value.
* Day 6 (*Wait For It*): See how far you can get a boat to travel in the allotted time. Can you beat the record time?
* Day 7 (*Camel Cards*): Analyze simple poker hands and determine total winnings.
* Day 8 (*Haunted Wasteland*): Given a set of directions and a map of locations, calculate the number of steps to the exit.
