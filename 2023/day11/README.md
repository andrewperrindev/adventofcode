# Advent of Code 2023
## Day 11: *Cosmic Expansion*

### Part 1

An astronomer shares with you their telescopic observations on galaxies. The input file is a text representation of the observations, where a `.` symbol represents open sky, and a `#` symbol represents a galaxy.

The astronomer wants to find the shortest path between each pair of galaxies. For example, given this input:

```
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#.....
```

There are a total of 9 galaxies. If we pair up each galaxy to every other galaxy, we end up with 36 pairs. Then, you must find the shortest path between each pair. You can only move one `.` or `#` at a time (paths can intersect other galaxies). Using the example above, one path looks like this:

```
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.**......#
..**......
...**..#..
#...#.....
```

Here, the path between two galaxies is represented by the `*` symbol. It takes `7 steps` to go from the first galaxy to the second (6 steps marked with `*` plus one more to arrive at the next galaxy itself).

This all seems simple enough, but there's a catch: the astronomer has discovered that the universe is expanding! In fact, it seems like any rows or columns in the input that are completely open space (contain only the `.` symbol) are actually twice as large as they appear. Looking at the above example, we see that there are actually two rows and three columns that only contain open space. If we double them, the example now looks like this:

```
....#........
.........#...
#............
.............
.............
........#....
.#...........
............#
.............
.............
.........#...
#....#.......
```

Each row of empty space becomes *two* rows of empty space. Likewise, each column of empty space becomes *two* columns of empty space. And so, our path is now a different length due to this extra space that needs to be traversed:

```
....#........
.........#...
#............
.............
.............
........#....
.#...........
.**.........#
..**.........
...**........
....**...#...
#....#.......
```

So after taking expansion into account, we can see it actually takes `9 steps` to get from the first galaxy to the second.

Write a program that:
* Applies the above rules of expansion to the provided input.
* Finds the smallest path between each unique pair of galaxies.
* Sums the length of all the paths together.

The final result is the sum calculated in the last step.

### Part 2

As the astronomer reviews their data, they realize this part of the universe is actually much older than originally assumed -- and, as a result, has been expanding for much longer than originally assumed too. Instead of empty rows and columns being *twice* as large, they're actually *one million timees* larger. In other words, each empty row or column should no longer be replaced with *two* empty rows or columns -- it should be replaced with *1000000* empty rows or columns.

Taking this new information into account, repeat the steps above, modifying your program if necessary. What is the new sum?
