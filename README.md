# Advent of Code

Each folder in this repo contains my solutions to a particular year in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) event. Like a traditional advent calendar, each day in December was a new coding challenge. In addition, each coding challenge had two parts.

There is a README in each folder to explain the context of that year's daily challenges.
