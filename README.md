# Advent of Code 2023

Each folder in this repo is a separate coding challenge that was part of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com) event. Like a traditional advent calendar, each day was a new coding challenge. In addition, each coding challenge had two parts.

There is a README in each folder to explain the context of that day's challenge, but here is the general introduction to the event, and a summary of each day's challenge.

## Introduction

Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.

You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").

## Summary

* Day 1 (*Trebuchet?!*): The calibration document was helpfully "improved" by an eager young elf, but now the correct values are difficult to read. Help uncover the correct values.
* Day 2 (*Cube Conundrum*): An Elf at the first location plays a game while walking with you. The game consists of various colored cubes in a bag. Cubes are randomly pulled out by the handful. Derive certain information about the games & the initial state given a set of final game outcomes.
* Day 3 (*Gear Ratios*): Use the gondola lift schematic to troubleshoot why it's moving so slowly. Discover part numbers & gear ratios by locating numbers & symbols in the schematic that are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically & diagonally.
